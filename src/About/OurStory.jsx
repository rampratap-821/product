                <p>Founded in 2010 by Sarah Johnson, Mart & Grocery started as a small neighborhood 
                    store with a simple mission:
                     to provide fresh, quality groceries while supporting local farmers and producers
                    What began as a single store has grown into a trusted brand with 15+ locations nationwide,
                     but our core values remain the same. We believe in sustainable practices, community building,
                      and making quality groceries accessible to everyone.
                    Today, we serve over 100,000 happy customers and offer more than 50,000 products,
                     all while maintaining the personal touch that made us successful from the beginning.</p>
